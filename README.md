# Simple HTML Card with Greeting

Project Overview: 

Welcome to the Simple HTML Card project! In this project, I created a basic HTML card that allows users to enter their name and click an "OK" button. Upon clicking the button, the card appears, and a personalized greeting is displayed in an alert box.

Features :

User Input: Enter your name into a text field.
Greeting Card: Click the "OK" button to reveal the card.
Personalized Alert: Displays a greeting with the entered name in an alert box.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structuring the card and input elements.
CSS: Styling the card and button for a clean and simple appearance.
JavaScript: Handling user input and displaying the alert box with a personalized greeting.
